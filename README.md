Air Quality Index (AQI) Project
Project Overview
The Air Quality Index (AQI) Project aims to monitor and visualize air quality levels in different regions. By collecting data from various sources, it provides real-time information on pollution levels and the potential health impact of air quality.

Features
Real-time AQI Monitoring: Display air quality levels for various pollutants (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, etc.).
Historical Data: View trends and patterns in air quality over time.
Health Recommendations: Provide suggestions based on the current AQI level.
Interactive Visualizations: Charts and graphs to visualize air quality metrics.
